# web-testing-tool

Developed an advanced tool for detecting and analyzing common vulnerabilities in websites, focusing on both frontend and backend security. The tool is designed to identify issues related to frontend technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and backend security (using Python and Bash), specifically targeting vulnerabilities like SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Remote Code Execution (RCE). This project aims to enhance the security posture of web applications by automating the detection process and providing actionable insights.
